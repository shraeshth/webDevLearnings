  <!-- 1. Basic image embedding with required attributes -->
        <!-- The <img> element is a void element (no closing tag), and must have a src and alt attribute -->
        <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur skeleton in a museum" />

  <!-- 2. Relative vs Absolute URLs -->
        <!-- Relative URLs are better for site portability and performance -->
        <!-- Absolute URLs can break when hosting changes, and hotlinking is discouraged -->
            <img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="External dinosaur image" />

  <!-- 3. Hotlinking Warning -->
  <!-- Do not use images hosted on someone else’s server without permission -->
  <!-- Hotlinking is unethical and unreliable -->

  <!-- 4. Replaced Elements -->
        <!-- <img> is a replaced element — its content comes from an external source -->
        <!-- Browser doesn't define its layout; the image file does -->

  <!-- 5. The alt Attribute -->
        <!-- Essential for accessibility and SEO -->
        <!-- Describes the content of the image when it can't be displayed -->
            <img
                src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
                alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with sharp teeth"
            />

  <!-- 6. Empty alt for decorative images -->
         <!-- Use alt="" if the image is purely decorative so screen readers skip it -->
            <img src="images/decorative-pattern.png" alt="" />

  <!-- 7. Image inside a link should still have accessible text -->
            <a href="https://example.com/museum">
                <img src="images/ticket.jpg" alt="Buy museum ticket online" />
            </a>

  <!-- 8. Avoid putting text in images -->
        <!-- Use CSS to style text instead of baking it into images -->

  <!-- 9. Width and Height attributes -->
        <!-- Helps reserve layout space and avoid layout shift (CLS) -->
        <!-- Specify image dimensions in pixels without units -->
            <img
                src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
                alt="Dinosaur skeleton exhibit"
                width="400"
                height="341"
            />

  <!-- 10. Don't use HTML to resize images -->
        <!-- Resize images using an image editor for proper quality -->
        <!-- Or use CSS with caution, ensuring aspect ratio is maintained -->

  <!-- 11. Image Title Attribute (use with care) -->
        <!-- Not reliably accessible — not keyboard friendly or consistently read by screen readers -->
        <!-- Prefer including this info in surrounding text instead -->
            <img
                src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
                alt="Dinosaur skeleton"
                width="400"
                height="341"
                title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum"
            />

  <!-- 12. Using <figure> and <figcaption> for semantic image-caption grouping -->
        <!-- Helps associate captions with images meaningfully for accessibility -->
            <figure>
                <img
                src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
                alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton with sharp teeth"
                width="400"
                height="341"
                />
                <figcaption>
                A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
